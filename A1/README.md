## 2. How to Read a Paper

This article explains how to read and analyze scientific articles correctly.
Key points:

1. The purpose of reading a scientific paper is to understand the scientific contribution that the authors make to their work.
2. Here are some guidelines to help you effectively read and analyze research papers:

- Read critically. Approach the paper with a critical mindset. Question the validity of the authors' arguments and conclusions. In order to think critically, you need to ask questions that will allow you to understand the material more deeply, as well as avoid false information.
- Read creatively. This means that you need to read the article in a more positive way than the author himself does. You need to ask questions - what ideas are really good at work, how else can the results of the work be applied, what more work can be done in order to expand the results of the work.
- Make notes.You need to take notes while reading the article. These can be critical thoughts, questions about a particular point, highlighting key points. The notes will help you read the article again in the future, help you structure the material that you have just read, and also show whether you have understood the material or not.
- Summarize Concisely. A good article almost always tries to answer some question. If you have found such an idea, try to outline the article in general terms. Deepen your understanding by outlining the three or four most important subpoints supporting the main idea.
- Compare with Other Works. Assess the scientific contribution of the paper by comparing it to other relevant literature.Determine if the ideas presented are truly novel or if similar concepts have been explored before.
