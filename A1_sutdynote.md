## I. 5-Minute Presentation
### A. Research
You need to do enough research to understand your topic and extract the most important concepts, even your material is limited for your five-minute presentation.
### B. Chose one important concept
One idea, concept, or point will be more than enough to make an impression and win an audience over. 

It must be the single most important point you have to make for the subject you are addressing.

### C. Keep slides simple
To make the audience focus on what you said, your slide should be really simple. Start from scratch rather than using a boring and noisy template. Design should be consistent by using the same font and color palette of 2-3 colors.

### D. Introduce the point with flair, immediately
Grab your audience's interest from the first sentence and don't let go. During a five-minute presentation, you have little time to build a case or draw them in.  

For slides, photo is great visaul to use in presentation. Make sure 
- only using images that you have permission to reuse
- pixel of the image is enough or it might look blurry
- make photos focal point near the points in belows figure, adding words also applicable<br><br><img src='upload_438817e9a0ba4dfc23617c9376584828.png' width='200'>

### E. Tell a story
A memorable presentation tells a memorable story. You should forgo all the statistics and numbers unless it is relevant to the point you are making. 

Keep the statistics portion as short as possible, and move on to how the audience will benefit from your information.

### F. Practice
Rehearsal is critical for such a short presentation. You have no time to pause or collect your thoughts. 

While you are rehearsing, don't simply go over the material. Practice your tone, inflections, and body language in front of the mirror. Record yourself and see how you sound.

> [!TIP]
> Never read from your slides

## II. How to Read a Paper
### A. Read critical
Do not assume that the authors are always correct. Ask the following questions:
- Problem 
    -   Is the problem to be solved correct?
    -   Are the assumptions reasonable?
- Solution
    -   Are there simple solutions not considered?
    -   What are the limitations of the solution?

- Data
    -  Did they gather the right data to substantiate their argument?
    -  Did they gather the data correctly?
    -   Did they interpret the data reasonably?
    -   Would other data be more compelling?

### B. Read creative
Think through the following questions:
1. What are the good ideas in this paper?
2. Do these ideas have other applications or extensions?
3. Can they be generalized further?
4. Are there possible improvements that might make significant practical differences?
5. What would be the next step if you were to start researching from this paper?

### C. Make notes as you read the paper
Taking notes is helpful when reading a paper for the first time and pays off when you have to revisit it months later.

If you have questions or criticisms, write them down. Underline key points. Mark the most important or questionable data.

###  D. Try to summarize the paper in one or two sentences
If you can succinctly describe a paper, you have likely identified the question the authors started with and the answer they provide.

If summarizing the paper in one or two sentences is easy, go back and try to deepen your outline by summarizing the three or four most important subpoints of the main idea.

### E. Compare the paper to other work
Comparing the paper to other works in the area can make you know if the ideas are genuinely novel or have been previously discussed.

Knowing other work in the area can help you to determine which sort of contribution a paper is actually making.

## III. How to Write a Report
Always keep the reader in mind. Be clear, concise and accurate, and use a recognisable structure.
### Structure
All reports have a similar structure and can include:
- #### Title page [opt]
- #### Executive summary [opt]
    The summary of:
    - the findings of the report
    - the conclusions 
    - the recommendations
- #### Contents page [opt]
    A list of the different sections and page numbers.

- #### Terms of reference
    This section introduces the report and explains why you’re writing it. It usually includes the following information:
    - What the report is about.
    - When the report is due.
    - Who asked for the report?
- #### Procedure
    This section explains how you investigated or researched the topic, i.e. what methods you used.
- #### Findings
    This is the main body of the report; it sets out the information you found when you investigated the topic.
- #### Conclusions
    This is where you interpret your findings. When you analyse the findings. New material shouldn’t be introduced here.

- #### Recommendations
    This section is for your suggested solution to the problem and/or what you think should happen next.

- #### References/bibliography
    This is an alphabetic list of all the sources you consulted. Use APA referencing for this.

- #### Appendices
    This section is for additional information that is relevant to the report, but would interrupt the flow of the text if included in the body of the report (e.g. brochures, large tables, or spreadsheets).


Different structures may combine these sections or break them down using additional subheadings.

Be sure to check your assessment instructions and learning outcomes.

>[!NOTE]
>If you’re still not sure, check with your course leader.
