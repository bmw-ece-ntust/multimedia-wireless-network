  - Maximize the time and get the most important information across to the audience
  - Creating a compelling, focused speech with a single message is the ultimate goal of the five-minute presentation
- What Can Be Accomplished in Five Minutes?

  - Do enough research to understand your topic and extract the most important concepts.
- Chose one important concept
  - One idea, concept, or point will be more than enough to make an impression and win an audience over.
- Practice
  - Rehearsal is critical for such a short presentation. You have no time to pause or collect your thoughts.
  - To engage your listeners, you will need to be smooth, steady and factual.
- Introduce the point with flair, immediately
  - Grab their interest from the first sentence, and don't let go.
- Tell a story
  - A memorable presentation tells a memorable story.
  - Keep the statistics portion as short as possible, and move on to the WIIFM (What's In It For Me) portion—how the audience will benefit from your information.
## 2. How to Read a Paper
### How to read a paper
- The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plowing your way to the end.
### THE THREE-PASS APPROACH
- The first pass
  - Get a bird’s-eye view ofthe paper. This pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:
    - Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
    - Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignoreeverything else
    - Read the conclusions
    - Mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read
- At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the five Cs:
  - Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
  - Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
  - Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
  - Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?
  - Clarity: Is the paper well written?
###  The second pass
- Read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs.
- Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs.
- Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading
### The third pass
- The key to the third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. Making you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.
### DOING A LITERATURE SURVEY
- First, use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent papers in the area. Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections.If you are lucky, a pointer to a recent survey paper.
- Second,Find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they’ve published recently. Because the best researchers usually publish in the top conferences.
- The third, visit the websites of these prestigious conferences and peruse the most recent proceedings. If all of them refer to a key paper that you were unable to locate earlier, get a copy of it and read it several times.
## 3. How to write a report
- Essays
  - Made up of
    - Introduction – which states what you will be talking about, how you will talk about it, and what you will show in the essay
    - Body – this is where you introduce your main points, explain them and give supporting evidence about each point and how it relates to your essay
    - Conclusion – Restate the topic discussed and summarise your main points, making the context of your argument clear. Where appropriate, you may also end with your recommendations.
- Presentations
  - Keypoints
    - Introduction – to introduce the topic and outline what you will cover
    - Body – to introduce and explain your main points
    - Conclusion – to sum up your main points.
    - Unlike an essay, you only need to show key information
- Quizzes
  - Include a range of question types
  - multiple choice
  - short answer
  - fill in the blanks
  - extended response
  - essay style.
- Reports
- Structure : a title page, an executive summary ,a contents page ,an introduction, terms of reference, procedure, findings, conclusions, recommendations, references/bibliography and appendices.
- Depending on the type of report you are writing some details may differ.
