## Study Note on Interpersonal Skills
- The following interpersonal skills are addressed in this report. These are :the art of 5-Minute Presentation, How to read a paper, How to write a report and 10 Tips for Better Teamwork
 ### 1. The art of 5-minute presentation
 - From an audience perspective, five-minute presentation is more engaging and less boring than a typical 60-minute talk. But it is the most challenging of all presentations to create and deliver.
- The ultimate goal of five-minute presentation is creating a compelling, focused speech with a single message. 
- The five important ways to create a successful 5-minute presentation for a memorable method of engaging your audience.

  -  **Research** :  Your material is limited for your five-minute presentation, you will need to do enough research to understand your topic and extract the most important concepts.

  - **Choose one important concept** : For the subject you are addressing, single idea/concept, or point will be enough to make an impression and win an audience

  - **Practice** : Rehearsal is critical for such a short presentation. You have no time to pause or collect our thoughts. Practice your tone, inflections, and body language in front of the mirror. Record yourself and see how you sound

  - **Introduce the point with flair, immediately** : Photos are a great visual to use in a presentation

  - **Tell a story** : A memorable presentation tells a memorable story. Keep data as simple as possible, and never read from slides

### 2. How to read a paper

- Reading a paper can be a frustrating experience, especially for the one who has not mastered the art of reading scientific literature.  You need to carefully read a paper to review it, or if it’s relevant to your own research.
- When you read a research paper, your goal is to understand the scientific contributions the authors are making. This is not an easy task. It may require going over the paper several times. Expect to spend several hours to read a paper.
- Here are guidelines to read a paper
  
   <ol> <b>a. 	Read critically</b>: Reading a research paper must be a critical process. You should not assume that the authors are always correct. Critical reading involves asking appropriate questions. 
   <ul> - are they solving the right problem? </ul>
   <ul> - Are there simple solutions the authors do not seem to have considered? </ul>
   <ul> - What are the limitations of the solution?</ul> <ul> - is the logic of the paper clear and justifiable?</ul> </ol><br>
   <ol><b> b. Read creatively</b> :  Reading a paper critically is easy, in that it is always easier to tear something down than to build it up. Reading creatively involves harder, more positive thinking.
  <ul>- What are the good ideas in this paper?</ul>
  <ul>- Are there possible improvements that might make important practical differences?</ul></ol><br>
  <ol><b> c. Make notes as you read the paper</b> : If you have questions or criticisms, write them down so you do not forget them. </ol> <br>
  <ol><b> d. After the first read-through, try to summarize the paper in one or two sentences</b></ol><br>
  <ol> <b>e. If possible, compare the paper to other works.</b></ol><br>
- In general, your one-page review should include the following:
  - a one or two sentence summary of the paper.
  - a deeper, more extensive outline of the main points of the paper, including for example assumptions made, arguments presented, data analyzed, and conclusions drawn.
  - any limitations or extensions you see for the ideas in the paper.
  - your opinion of the paper; primarily, the quality of the ideas and its potential impact

### 3. How to write a report

 - A report is where you present your investigation and analysis of information or an issue, recommending actions and making proposals. It  is a communication of information, from a person who has collected and studied the facts.
 -  When writing a report, always keep the reader in mind. Be clear, concise and accurate, and use a recognisable structure.<br>
 - A typical structure and style have evolved to convey essential information and ideas as concisely and effectively as possible. Precise formats vary by discipline and scientific journal, but always treat them as flexible guidelines that enable clear communication.<br>
 - Outlines to write a report<br>
   <ul>* <b>	Title page</b> : Reports may also start with a separate title page which includes affliations.</ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>  Executive summary</b> : A summary of the findings of the report, the conclusions and the recommendations.</ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>Table of contents page</b> : A list of the different sections and page numbers.</ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>Introduction</b> : Establish background information and state what the report addresses.</ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>Terms of reference</b> : This section introduces the report and explains why you’re writing it, i.e. the purpose.</ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>Procedure</b> : explains how you investigated or researched the topic, i.e. what methods you used.</ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>Findings</b> : main body of the report; it sets out the information you found when you investigated the topic.</ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>Conclusions</b> : interpret your findings, i.e. your conclusions when you analyse the findings. New material shouldn’t be introduced here.</ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>Recommendations</b> :  suggested solution and/or the action(s) you recommend.</ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>References/bibliography</b> : list of all the sources you consulted. </ul><br>
   <ul>* <b>Appendices</b> : additional information that is relevant to the report, but would interrupt the flow of the text if included in the body of the report </ul><br>
