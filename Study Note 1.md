# B. How to Read a Paper 

## Introduction

<p align="justify">
This report discusses the challenge researchers face when reading multiple papers for reviewing, staying updated, and conducting literature reviews in new fields. The author, S. Keshav, in the paper "How to Read a Paper," outlines strategies to read information faster and retain important details while skipping irrelevant parts. He introduced a simple three pass approach to effectively read research papers and its usage in literature survey.
</p>

## B.1. The three pass approach 

<p align="justify">
The three pass approach strategy introduces three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and reading the whole paper. It breaks reading the paper into multiple times allows you to have a lesser focus on certain parts of the paper. 
</p>

### First pass:
<p align="justify">
This step involves gaining a general understanding of the entire paper, which aids in planning what areas to focus on for deeper study. It also helps in formulating questions that will assist in comprehending the content thoroughly. It involves 
</p>

* A rapid reviewing a paper within 5~10 minutes
* Focusing on reading the abstract, introduction
* Focusing on reading all titles and headings
* Formulating questions about the paper, and 
* Ignoring the actual body of the work.

After the first pass strategy, the reader should be able to answer the five Cs：
1. Categroy：type of the paper?
2. Content：related papers and theoretical bases that was used to analyze the problem?
3.	Correctness： assumptions are appear to be valid
4.	Contributions：main contributions
5.	Clarity： well written?
   
### Second pass: 
<p align="justify">
Comparing to the first pass strategy, this step involves reviewing a paper within 1 hour if you're familiar with the content and 4-5 hours if you're new to reading research papers. However, don’t focus on detailed proofs. 
</p>
    

* Carefully look at the graphs, data and figures.
* Point out the most relevant references for later review 
* make comments in the margins
* jot down the key points

After the second pass, the reader should summarize the main content.
### Third pass:

<p align="justify">
In this phase, attempting to virtually re-implement a research paper with the same assumptions as the authors is a crucial step in understanding the work thoroughly. By recreating the study, you can uncover any hidden flaws or assumptions that might not have been apparent initially. This process helps in validating the findings and allows for a deeper understanding of the research methodology and results.
    
At the end of third pass, you need to reconstruct the structure of the paper and able to identify its strong and weak points.
    </p>
    
## B.2. Doing a literature survey:

During literature survey, the three pass approach can be employed in the following steps:

Step 1: Use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent papers in the area.

Step 2: Find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliograohy.

Step 3 Go to the website for these top conference and look through their recent proceedings.
