## 2. How to Read a Paper?
This article is all about how to read a research paper and give it a proper critique. It points out some pretty important factors to consider:

- **Critical Reading:** 
    - When reading a research paper, it's essential to think critically. Don't just accept the author's viewpoint blindly; instead, question it. Is the author truly solving the problem, or are there simpler solutions they haven't considered? Are there limitations to the solutions proposed in the paper? Do the author's assumptions make sense? Is the logic of the paper sound? Do the data provided by the author strongly support their claims? Are their methods for data collection reliable? Asking these questions helps us delve deeper into the paper's content.

- **Creative Reading:** 
    - Think about where the author could improve and how you would approach the problem differently. What are the differences between your method and the author's? I think this is something crucial to consider when reading a paper.

- **Taking Notes while Reading:** 
    - Taking notes regularly helps reinforce memory and allows you to jot down your own perspectives.

- **Summarizing the Paper in a Sentence or Two after the First Read:**
    - If you can summarize the paper concisely, you might have already grasped the initial problem the author presented and their proposed solutions. Then, you can revisit the paper and try to outline its more specific details, deepening your understanding.

- **Comparing the Paper to Other Works if Possible:** 
    - Evaluating a paper's scientific contribution requires comparing it to other relevant works. Through comparison, we can determine if the paper's ideas are innovative and understand their practical contributions to the field.
## 3. How to Write a Report?

This article is basically about how to plan and structure your papers, presentations, and reports to assess some learning outcomes. For papers, it's crucial to include the three main sections: introduction, body, and conclusion. Check if your paper aligns with these points to improve and evaluate your writing skills. Presentations follow a similar structure with three main pillars: introduction, body, and conclusion. However, unlike papers, presentations need to be more concise for organization and clarity. Report structures are more complex, with various sections like title page, executive summary, content pages, introduction, and so on. There are also different types and formats of reports, each with its own structure, so you should try to learn which types of reports are currently more suitable for you.
