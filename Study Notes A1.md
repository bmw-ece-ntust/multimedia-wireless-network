# Introduction

These study notes try to capture the most important information of the given sources for the first assignment. The different topics are divided into chapters that can be read independently of each other. Depending on the topic the style of the study notes can change depending on the complexity and interdependency of the different points.

# 5 Minute Presentation

* *+* More engaging
  + No unnecessary information
  + Suitable for limited time and attention span of audience
  


* *-* Difficult to cover all important information
  - Limited amount of information
  - Condensing information takes a lot of time for the presenter


* Workflow:
    - Research the topic
    - Condense and select most important information
    - Find a hook to get the audience attention at the beginning
    - String a continuous story from this. ItÂ´s good if there is a personal connection for the audience.
    - Practice a lot and make sure not to read from the slides


Be aware of the audience and adjust the presentation style and content accordingly.

* Slide design:
    - Few words, the slide should support the oral presentation and not replace it so avoid full sentences and focus on keywords
    - Interesting, but not too distracting
    - Clean structure with ideally one key point per slide
    - Easy to read type fonts and clear design
    - Use pictures that support the point you are talking about (either by showing something technical or by supporting the feeling you want to create in the audience)
    - Avoid pictures that are very generic or where you do not have the right to use them
    - Try to put the focus point of images closer to the center, but not directly at the center
    - Simplify complex graphs to show the most important things
    - Stick to a design style and repeat design elements throughout the presentation to create a cohesive design language (Use a slide Master)

# How to Read a Paper

Reading a paper should be an active process that takes a lot of time. The reader should think about what the next steps would be, what is said and implied and what kind of biases are present in the paper. You should take your own notes to better condense the information into something you properly understand. The key concepts should be extracted and the paper summarized. It can be helpful to break the paper down into one or two sentences after you have read it.

Key questions to ask yourself are
* :
    - What question or problem does the paper wants to answer or to solve?
    - What is the method, approach or technique chosen to achieve this goal?
    - Can the initial answer be sufficiently answered?
    - Can this answer be sufficiently by the presented reasoning and data?
    - May there be any bias present in the paper? Maybe some metrics that are given in other papers are suspiciously absent or other solutions are shown in worse light than in other papers from different authors.

In general, you should read critically and creatively. So, you should question each statement made and think about the implications of the statement. You should also always check other papers from different authors about the same topic to verify given information and to find potential omissions or biases.



# How to Write a Report

* What is a Report? :
    - Present investigation or analysis on a certain topic or issue
    - Recommend actions and propose possible solutions

Be aware of the readers previous knowledge about the topic. Keep the language in the report accurate, precise and stick to a clear structure.

Depending on the type of report you must adjust the structure and language.

* A general structure can be:
    - Title page
    - Short summary (abstract)
    - Content page
    - Introduction
    - Purpose and structure of a project
    - Procedure/Methodology 
    - Findings
    - Conclusions
    - Recommendations
    - Bibliography
    - Possible appendices

Depending on the type and length of the report several of these points can be shortened or omitted. 

# 10 Tips for Better Teamwork

Work culture in organization has a great influence on the teamwork capabilities a group. Different viewpoints and experiences must come together in a productive, respectful and effective process when working as a team on a shared project. To achieve this certain norms in communication form by them self or are consciously formed. To achieve this, it is important to set clear expectations and responsibilities.

* Creating an environment for good and productive teamwork is based on:

    - Clear mission and goals (what is supposed to be achieved and until when)
    - Encouragement of reasonable risks (the team and individual people should try out something new on their own)
    - Respectful communication (people respect other people and their opinion)
    - Strong sense of commitment (people must believe and commit to the choices taken and the project in general)
    - The unique viewpoints of individual team members are taken into account and their opinions are heard (benefiting from different backgrounds and experiences)
    - Incentivizing continuous self-improvement and self-assessment (finding mistakes and improving processes)
    - Solving problems and conflicts in a combined team effort instead of personal conflicts between individuals of the team
    - Clearly assigning and recording accountabilities and responsibilities to avoid confusion and prevent tasks from being left over at the end
    - All members of the team must participate in big decisions of the problem to get them more involved with the outcome, but the individual members of the team must also be able to make small project and leadership decisions on their own to increase efficiency
