# Introduction

In this project, I use the ns-3 simulator to create a network that consists of an Access Point (AP) and three stations (STAs). The AP and the STAs are configured to operate using the IEEE 802.11 standard with Quality of Service (QoS) support, specifically utilizing the 802.11e TXOP (Transmission Opportunity) mechanism. Each station continuously transmits data packets to the AP, simulating a network environment where different types of traffic (voice, video, and best effort) compete for bandwidth.

The goal of this simulation is to replicate the results obtained in a referenced research paper. The research paper analyzes the performance of a network under varying traffic loads and measures the throughput achieved by each traffic category. 

This project can be divided into 2 main parts, the first part is the implementation of the simulation. And the second part is the analysis of the results generated by the simulator.


# Implementation of the Simulator

The implementation of the ns3 simulator can be done either on python or in C++. I decided to implement it using C++ since I found more examples scripts on C++ in the examples provided by ns3.

The implementation can be divided into simulation set-up, network set-up, QoS parameters configuration and output of results.

### Simulation Set-Up

In the simulation setup, I initialize various parameters required for the simulation. These include setting the port number, payload size, traffic start and end times, and traffic increment values. Additionally, the csv output file is opened for logging the simulation results.

### Network Set-Up

The network is composed of one Access Point (AP) and four stations (STAs). Each station represents a different Access Category (AC): Voice (AC_VO), Video (AC_VI), Best Effort (AC_BE), and Background (AC_BK). These stations continuously transmit data packets to the AP.

Network topology :

             AP
   +---------+---------+
   |         |          |        
  STA A     STA B     STA C

```

### QoS Parameters 

The QoS parameters for each AC are configured based on the values provided by the research paper. These parameters include the Arbitration Inter-Frame Space (AIFS), the minimum contention window size (CWmin) and the maximum contention window sizes (CWmax).


Values utlize in research paper:

### Output the Results

For each traffic rate that the simulation iterates through, the results are printed to the console and saved in a CSV file. The output includes the current traffic load and the throughput achieved for each Access Category (AC).


Example of CSV file generated:

# Analysis of Results

As mentioned previously the files results of the simulation are saved into a csv file. To analyze this results, I use a simple python code that using the matplot library creates a graph showing how the Throughput of the AC types chages as the traffic increases.

### Python Code for Creating the Graph

```python

import csv
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def read_csv(filename):
    data = {'x': [], 'vi': [], 'vo': [], 'be': [], 'bk': []}
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        for row in reader:
            data['x'].append(float(row[0]))  # Current Traffic AC
            data['vi'].append(float(row[1]))  # Throughput AC_VI
            data['vo'].append(float(row[2]))  # Throughput AC_VO
            data['be'].append(float(row[3]))  # Throughput AC_BE
            data['bk'].append(float(row[4]))  # Throughput AC_BK
    return data

def plot_graph(data):
    plt.figure(facecolor='black')
    ax = plt.gca()
    ax.set_facecolor('black')
    
    plt.plot(data['x'], data['x'], label='Traffic', color='white')
    plt.plot(data['x'], data['vi'], label='AC_VI', color='blue')
    plt.plot(data['x'], data['vo'], label='AC_VO', color='green')
    plt.plot(data['x'], data['be'], label='AC_BE', color='red')
    plt.plot(data['x'], data['bk'], label='AC_BK', color='grey')
    
    plt.title('Throughput per AC with increasing offered traffic per AC', color='white')
    
    plt.xlabel('Current Traffic AC', color='white')
    plt.ylabel('Throughput (Mbps)', color='white')
    
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True, color='gray')
    
    ax.tick_params(axis='x', colors='white')
    ax.tick_params(axis='y', colors='white')
    
    plt.show()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    filename = "/home/f11215125/Desktop/ns-allinone-3.41/ns-3.41/my_output/simulation_output.csv"
    data = read_csv(filename)
    plot_graph(data)



```

The script reads the CSV file and plots the throughput for each AC category against the current traffic load.
