### I.I Mastering the Art of the Five-Minute Presentation

You can accomplish.

#### I.I Research 

- Compress enough material into a five-minute presentation.
- Master your material through extensive research on your topic.

#### I.II Chose one Important Concept

- Keep your statements on a single point theme

#### I.III Practice

- Be articulate. There is no time to sutter infront of your audience, especially if your time is limited. Rehearse your presentation repeatedly, it's better to stumble during rehearsal than infront of your audience.
- The way you deliver will determine how your audience precieves you. Too stiff and you look incompotent; too overly theatrical and you will look like a [snake oil salesman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWhGHxrK9w8).

#### I.IV Introduce the point with flair, immediately

- Your entire presentation will be determined by your first staement.

#### I.V Tell a Story

- Present your material in a way that the audience could get the benefit out of it.

### I.II 5 Tips in 5 Minutes - Presentation

#### I.II.I Keep It Simple

- Avoid unecessary slide accessory as you want your audience listened to you and not get distracted by your presentation too much.

#### I.II.II Never Read From Your Slides

- Human brain is bad at procesing audio and text at the same time 
- Using small amount of text can help your audience remember your main points
- Remember to put only one point on each slide

#### I.II.III Use Beautiful Photos

- Using photos on your presentation enables your audience to have an emotional reaction
- Remember to use only photos that you have permission to use and avoid using cheesy unrelated stock photo that adds nothing to the context.
- Arrange the photo you used so that your text is still readable and not overshadowed by the main object inside the photo.

#### I.II.IV  Keep Your Data Simple

- Make sure your data is as simple as possible allowing your audience to digest the information.
- Your data should convey your argument not the other way arround. 

#### I.II.V Reptition

- Maintain consistent design on each slides.
