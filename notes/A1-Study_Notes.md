## I. Tasks 1: 5-Minute Presentation 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Study Material:**
>   - *[How to Create an Unforgettable 5-Minute Presentation](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/mastering-the-art-of-the-5-minute-presentation-2951697)*

### I.I Mastering the Art of the Five-Minute Presentation

#### I.I Research 

- Compress enough material into a five-minute presentation.
- Master your material through extensive research on your topic.

#### I.II Chose one Important Concept

- Keep your statements on a single point theme

#### I.III Practice

- Be articulate. There is no time to sutter infront of your audience, especially if your time is limited. Rehearse your presentation repeatedly, it's better to stumble during rehearsal than infront of your audience.
- The way you deliver will determine how your audience precieves you. Too stiff and you look incompotent; too overly theatrical and you will look like a [snake oil salesman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWhGHxrK9w8).

#### I.IV Introduce the point with flair, immediately

- Your entire presentation will be determined by your first staement.

#### I.V Tell a Story

- Present your material in a way that the audience could get the benefit out of it.

### I.II 5 Tips in 5 Minutes - Presentation

#### I.II.I Keep It Simple

- Avoid unecessary slide accessory as you want your audience listened to you and not get distracted by your presentation too much.

#### I.II.II Never Read From Your Slides

- Human brain is bad at procesing audio and text at the same time 
- Using small amount of text can help your audience remember your main points
- Remember to put only one point on each slide

#### I.II.III Use Beautiful Photos

- Using photos on your presentation enables your audience to have an emotional reaction
- Remember to use only photos that you have permission to use and avoid using cheesy unrelated stock photo that adds nothing to the context.
- Arrange the photo you used so that your text is still readable and not overshadowed by the main object inside the photo.

#### I.II.IV  Keep Your Data Simple

- Make sure your data is as simple as possible allowing your audience to digest the information.
- Your data should convey your argument not the other way arround. 

#### I.II.V Reptition

- Maintain consistent design on each slides.

## II. Tasks 2: How to Read a Paper

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Study Material:**
>   - *[How To Read A Paper](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/ReadPaper.pdf)*
> 

- Read critically
    - Never assume that the writer produces something flawless. Always look for areas where there is room for improvement.
- Read Creatively
    - Rather than critiquing the paper, try stepping into the shoes of the writer. Consider what might be missing and what the next steps in research could be given the current conclusion. Also, think about how this research could be integrated with other studies
- Make Notes
    - Write down your remarks directly on the copies of the papers. Underline key ideas and write comments where necessary. Engaging in the physical act of writing will help reinforce memory and make a lasting impression.
- Try to summarize the paper in one or two sentences.
    - Understanding a paper well enough to summarize it in one or two sentences is a clear sign of comprehension. With the main idea in hand, you can then delve into specific details for a deeper understanding.
- Compare the paper to other works.
    - Compare the paper with another piece of literature to determine if it offers a unique contribution. Identify whether the paper brings something different to the table.
