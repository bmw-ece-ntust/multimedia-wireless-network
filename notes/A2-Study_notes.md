	:::
3. **Access https://minio.bmw.lab on **another tab** from your browser**

	:::warning
	:warning: **WHY ?** 
    
    1. This step is neccessary to allow clients into to the data storage server that hosts images uploaded on the outline page. Without this you can upload image into the outline but can not see them.
	2. You will get this error from trying to reach minio.bmw.lab, ***it's fine***. You only need to whitelist this page on your browser by doing this.
